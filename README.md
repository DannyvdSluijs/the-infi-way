An overview of _how_ we like to build software: which techniques and technology we like to use, and which principles we follow when building software.

## ðŸ§¡ Context

There are many ways to look at software development
**The Infi Way** is one of those, from a larger set of view points:

- **_Who_ we are**, what we believe in, and what we find important: you can read this in [the Infi Manifest (Dutch)](https://infi.nl/manifest/).
- **_Wie_ we _literally_ are**, you'll find at [infi.nl/wij-zijn-infi (Dutch)](https://infi.nl/wij-zijn-infi/) and if you want to be part of our team, at [werkenbij.infi.nl (Dutch)](https://werkenbij.infi.nl/).
- **_What_ we build**, for which customners, and the kind of products: you'll find this at [infi.nl/onze-klanten (Dutch)](https://infi.nl/onze-klanten/).
- **_How_ we _generally_ do this**, and how we like to work: you can find this at [infi.nl/software (Dutch)](https://infi.nl/software/).
- **_How_ we do this _technology wise_**, is what [you read in The Infi Way](https://infi-nl.github.io/the-infi-way): so _here_!
- And surely more methods later on...

The Infi Way is a little peek into our engineering efforts.
The way in which and tools and techniques we think are mandatory for building software the right way.

## ðŸ’» Open Source!?

For sure!

First up, the git history can be interesting to view.
To see how we got here in the first place.
Plus, we also _enjoy_ developing this "in the open".

Second, we would love for others to share this setup with more people.
And when the time comes, perhaps also remix this content to their own liking.
For that we do need to fix [issue #3](https://github.com/infi-nl/the-infi-way/issues/3) and choose a proper license to allow that.

Either way, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/infi-nl/the-infi-way/issues/new) and/or [submit a PR](https://github.com/infi-nl/the-infi-way/pulls)!
We always welcome new points of view.

## ðŸ”’ In closing

Hopefully The Infi Way is interesting or perhaps even _useful_ to you!?
If you ever have questions for the originators from Infi, we hope [you'll be able to find us](https://infi.nl/contact/)?
